## Types of contributions

Provide information on what kinds of contributions your project is looking for
here. For example these can be bug reports, help with answering user questions,
improving documentation, fixes to bugs, as well as new feature implementations.

## Bug reports

hints about which type of information the project will need in order to
reproduce and fix issues. It can also include information on commonly found
mis-configurations that look like bugs.

Also include information on what contributors can expect in terms of time to
first response and process after that.

## Feature requests

## Contributing documentation

Include information on any documentation best practices your project follows as

## Contributing source code

This section should contain information on

- How to access the project source code,
- General project layout,
- Any requirements to the development environment,
- Code formatting guidelines,
- How to run the test suite.

## How to become a Trusted Committer

This section should make the process for becoming a Trusted Committer explicit
if that route is open to contributors.

## How to nominate Trusted Committers

This section serves as a reminder to existing and explanation for new Trusted
Committers detailing how to add others to the host team. Again ideally this
information is identical for all projects in the organisation so central
