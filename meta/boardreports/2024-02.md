## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns][] repository:

* new donut pattern:
	* [Sustainable InnerSource Program](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/sustainable-innersource-program.md)
* translations
	* translation to [Galician](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/releases/tag/v1.9). This translation into the Galician language was prepared by AMTEGA (Xunta de Galicia), and coordinated by their Free Software Office. Worth pointing out that this is the first contribution to our patterns (that I am aware of) that was co-financed through European funds. - thank you @psanxiao for facilitating this process
	* they even translated the mindmap of patters to Galician, which was a 1st!
	* this motivated the community to do the same for the Brazilian Portuguese translation - thank you @zilio!
* additions of Known Instances (applications of our patterns in the wild)
	* Airbus (to [various patterns](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/explore-patterns?q=airbus)) - thank you @sicot-f
	* WellSky to [InnerSource portal](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/innersource-portal#known-instances). This contribution also included a description of their implementation approach as a simple Confluence Wiki page. Thank you @rrrutledge
	* Bosch to [InnerSource License](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/innersource-license) - thank you @gruetter
* our new-ish **welcome bot** is doing what it is supposed to do, greeting new contributors and points them to helpful info about our contribution process. e.g. see how the bot works on [this PR](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/652#issuecomment-1929078394)
* we are now automatically compiling [various community metrics](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22community+metrics%22) on an ongoing basis, to understand the contribution patterns better

## Things to come

* (still) toying with the idea to add [Adopters pages](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns-staging/v/adopters-test/adopters/adopters) to our book. Goal: showcase the organizations and the patterns they use more prominently in our book. Looking for feedback! More [details here](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/623).
* we are stuck on some PRs that were opened some time back, where we (mostly @spier) did not have time to review them properly or the communication stopped somewhere
  * pattern proposal [Feature Owner](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/573) by Manoj Gawande (@magawande) from Fidelty (part of FINOS?) - new contributor!
  * proposal to add a [Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/556) to the **Standard Base Documentation** pattern - by Jose Roman Martin Gil (@rmarting) from Red Hat - new contributor?

## Trusted Committers (Community)

* Last [Trusted Committer][] added was [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* Trusted Committer candidates in the pipeline: No
* Finding new contributors and further trusted committers continues to be the main challenge of the InnerSource Patterns project
