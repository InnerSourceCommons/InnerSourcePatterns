  * Japanese (/v/ja) - no data in Google Analytics. no idea why.
  * Chinese (/v/zh) - 545
  * Brazilian Portuguese (/v/pt-br) - 358
  * Galician (/v/gl) - 68

## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns][] repository:

* new patterns:
  * [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/code-of-conduct.md) - thank you [rmarting](https://github.com/rmarting)
  * [InnerSource Hackathon](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/innersource-hackathon.md) - thank you [spriya-m](https://github.com/spriya-m)
  * [Trusted Committer and Contributor Retrospectives](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/cross-team-retrospectives.md) - thank you [MaineC](https://github.com/MaineC)
  * especially exciting because the first two came from new or infrequent contributors
* translations
  * nothing new
* additions of Known Instances (applications of our patterns in the wild)
  * GitHub to new Code of Conduct pattern. Thank you @zkoppert
* some additions to the glossary. still very few entries in the glossary, however we now [published](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/appendix/glossary) it in the patterns book. maybe that we motivate us to extend it.
* would like to do one round of cleanup of old PRs/issues that are unlikely to still be implemented as they are stale for too long

## Things to come

* (still) toying with the idea to add [Adopters pages](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns-staging/v/adopters-test/adopters/adopters) to our book. Goal: showcase the organizations and the patterns they use more prominently in our book. Looking for feedback! More [details here](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/623).
* Some PRs are stuck. Reason is mostly that I (@spier) have less time to review things or communication with the contributor stopped somewhere

## Trusted Committers (Community)

* Last [Trusted Committer][] added was [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* Trusted Committer candidates in the pipeline: No
* Finding new contributors and further trusted committers continues to be the main challenge of the InnerSource Patterns project

## Next Goals
