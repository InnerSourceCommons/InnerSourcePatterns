# InnerSource Patterns WG - Report for Governance Meeting 2022-02

## Reporting Period

Nov 1st, 2021 - Jan 31st, 2022

## Mission

*Briefly describe what your project actually does.*

- Discuss community InnerSource practices and dynamics, collect and document agreed upon best practices of how to do InnerSource - in the form of patterns
- Continuously publish the most mature patterns as an ebook and website

## Overview

- 1 new pattern
- ~6500 page views of our [patterns book](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/) / ~ 72 per day
- some more discussions about patterns are happening in #innersource-patterns
- patterns get mentioned frequently in Community Calls
- improvements to our [Contributor Handbook](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/contributor-handbook.md) might help others to review PRs
- struggling to find more Trusted Committers
- no office hours in EU/Americas time slots

## Pattern Work

- new Initial pattern: [Balancing Openness and Security](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/balancing-openness-and-security.md) (aka "Secure InnerSource" by two new contributors (@bartgolsteijn and @arlou)
- new Structured pattern (published in our book): [Document your Guiding Principles](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/document-your-guiding-principles)
- merging old PRs of Initial patterns by @nyeates that had been stale since 2017 (readers are more likely to find pattern ideas in the in the main branch than in PRs):
  - [Overcoming the Not-Invented-Here Mindset](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/not-invented-here.md)
  - [Culture Change through Hiring](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/cultural-change-through-hiring.md)
- new pattern ideas:
  - InnerSource Contractor Model Terms - @claredillon
  - Transitioning Contractor Code to InnerSource Model - @claredillon
  - Hive mind - @mishari
  - Truth and Reconcilliation - @mishari
  - Operational Model for InnerSource - @dicortazar  
- all: [merged PRs](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pulls?q=is%3Apr+closed%3A2021-11-01..2022-01-31+is%3Amerged+), [opened issues](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2021-11-01..2022-01-31+is%3Aopen)

## Future goals

- actively reaching out to orgs that already talk about their InnerSource work publicly. Help them to contribute their patterns.
- hardening the patterns further, by finding 3 known instances for some of the patterns in the book (improves quality and increases trustworthiness of the patterns)
- level-up more patterns from the GitHub repo to the book. The patterns in the book seem to get more exposure to interested readers.
- trying out other ways to make the patterns easier to discover (e.g. different pattern categories; index pages at the end of the book or similar)
- try out other forms of engagement around patterns (office hours, "pattern of the month", etc)

## Last Committer Addition

*When was the last committer added to the project? A healthy project tends to add new committers regularly. The report should indicate the most recent date on which a committer was added.*

- 11th of December 2020: @spier
- 24th of April 2020: @lenucksi

## Committer Diversity

*Cover committer diversity in your project. A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. What are your steps to make sure that people from all regions on the globe can participate in your project without having to be awake at midnight their local time?*
