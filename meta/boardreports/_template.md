# Quarterly Report for Governance Meeting

Reminder: The report should not exceed half a page

## Summary (mandatory)

| Key Fact |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Working Group | *The name of your working group e.g. Patterns* |
| Reporting Period | *e.g. Feb/March/April 2021* |
| Mission | *Briefly describe what your project does.* |

## Project/Community Status and Health (mandatory)

Sum up the status and health of your project and community in a few sentences.

## Project Activity (mandatory)

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

## Committer Diversity (mandatory if no Committer was added recently)

In the Patterns Working Group we interpret the term **Committer** here in the sense of [Trusted Committer](../../TRUSTED-COMMITTERS.md).

A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. To achieve that it needs a sufficient amount of committer diversity.

How do you make sure that people from all regions on the globe can participate in your project without having to be awake at midnight their local time?
