## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns] repository:

* [Chinese book](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/v/zh/) release in 2023/01
* The issue with getting Japanese content indexed by Google and other search engines has been fixed (by gitbook)
* New **Structured** patterns:
    * [Extensions to Manage Contributions at Scale](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/extensions-for-sustainable-growth) - great work @Ssukriti
* New **Initial** patterns:
    * [Incubator Pipeline](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/incubator-pipeline.md) - thanks @robtuley for moving this long-standing PR along and getting the content into our repo for greater visibility of the ISC community
    * [InnerSource Customer Interview Questions](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/innersource-customer-interview-questions.md) - contributed by @kschueths as part of the last Summit. Thank you!
* Adding Known Instances to various patterns e.g. WellSky, Dazn, and Mercado Libre. Special thanks to @privero-meli from our community in Brazil for adding Mercado Libre.
* We are trying out GitHub Releases ([example](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/releases/tag/v1.4)) to highlight all contributors to our book. We hope that they will appreciate that acknowledgement, and continue their contributions.
* Various minor updates to existing patterns.
* Recorded [20 instructional YouTube videos on InnerSource Patterns in Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbfXGedu81g&list=PLzsDnO3v-utv349AtbxElYAqrXN6XZVqR). All will be rolled out in Q1 and Q2 of CY2023. We hope that the InnerSource Patterns page and the Japanese page will benefit from improved SEO. - Amazing job @yuhattor, even throwing some AI at it to [generate decks out of our patterns](https://github.com/yuhattor/innersource-patterns-decks) semi-automatically!
* Last Trusted Committer added was [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* Trusted Committer candidates in the pipeline: No
* How many people participate regularly: 3-5
    * 3 users participate regularly (all of them are Trusted Committers)
    * 1-2 users participate less frequently but still regularly
    * no hard data on this, mostly gut feeling

## Next Goals (same as previous Board report)

The overall goals of this group are:

1. Increase number of people consuming the patterns. ("easier to discover", pattern of month, categories)
2. Increase the number and quality of patterns.
   1. Increase the number of people thinking to contribute. ("patterns in wild", "known instances")
   2. Increase probability of successful contribution. ("reduce review time", "lower barrier of entry")
   3. Optimise the existing content. (level-up more patterns, "known instances" again)

All goals will be progressed but we are prioritising effort towards 2.iii.

Specifically we want to get existing **Initial (L1)** patterns improved to **Structured (L2)**, so that we can publish them in the book.

We had a [discussion](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/486#discussion_r1029921121) about this and created a short-list of those patterns (details below).

### Shortlisted Patterns

Here you find more detail about the possible execution of this approach.
It is more information than what the Board needs. It may however help you to understand how we are reasoning about our patterns.

We identified these patterns as "low-hanging fruits", as they contain a **Known Instance** already, and that info is often hard to get.

We believe we can contact the respective authors/organizations, and ask them to review the patterns against the [Structured (L2) Requirements](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/contributor-handbook.md#requirements-level-2---structured). The upside for those orgs is to get their pattern (and brand) published in our book.

We expect that with one round of review (or rather a single PR) we can get these patterns published in our book.

* **(done)** (IBM) [extensions-to-manage-contributions-at-scale.md](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/extensions-for-sustainable-growth)
* **(in progress)** (Comcast) [release-process.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/release-process.md) - We kept this pattern in Initial to give the community time to review/harden this pattern before it goes into the book.
* **(in progress)** (Flutter, Europace) [governance-levels.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/governance-levels.md) - Proposed by Europace (Isabel) but further improved by Rob.
* (??? Tim Yao, Georg Gr√ºtter) [contained-innersource.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/contained-innersource.md) - This pattern has been around for a long time. It can try to contact the two authors and see if they want to bring it over the finish line.
