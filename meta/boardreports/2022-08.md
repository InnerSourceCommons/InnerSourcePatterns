# InnerSource Patterns WG - Report for Board Meeting 2022-08

## Reporting Period

May 1st, 2022 - July 31st, 2022

## Mission

- Discuss community InnerSource practices and dynamics, collect and document agreed upon best practices of how to do InnerSource - in the form of patterns
- Publish the most mature patterns at [patterns.innersourcecommons.org](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org)
- Support local communities to translate the patterns to their language

## Overview

- Mature patterns were translated to [Japanese](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/v/jp/)! yay!
- [Yuki Hattori](https://github.com/yuhattor) joined as Trusted Committer - yay! (he drove the JP translation effort). Seems like he has collected an enthusiastic crowd already to push the Japanese InnerSource Community forward.
- we now have the infrastructure/tooling to translate our patterns to other languages - Chinese anybody?
- 47% increase of page views of our [patterns book](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/)
  - ~12.100 page views total (last 8.200)
  - ~134 per day
- 1 new pattern (Inital)
- some discussions about patterns are happening in #innersource-patterns
- we need more Trusted Committers
- no office hours in EU/Americas time slots

- references:
    - [merged PRs][merged-prs]
    - [opened issues][opened-issues]

## Future Goals

- help the Japanese InnerSource Community to channel new patterns into this repo (in English + Japanese)

*below same as in previous report*

- reduce the time that PRs stay in review
- reduce the time it takes from posting a pattern idea to opening a first PR (lower the barrier for entry)
- actively reaching out to orgs that already talk about their InnerSource work publicly. Help them to contribute their patterns. => see **Patterns in the Wild** in [2022-05 report](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/boardreports/2022-05.md#pattern-work)
- hardening the patterns further, by finding 3 known instances for some of the patterns in the book (improves quality and increases trustworthiness of the patterns) => see **Known Instances Collection** in [2022-05 report](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/boardreports/2022-05.md#pattern-work)
- level-up more patterns from the GitHub repo to the book (i.e. from Level 1 to Level 2). The patterns in the book seem to get more exposure.
- trying out other ways to make the patterns easier to discover (e.g. different pattern categories; index pages at the end of the book or similar)
- try out other forms of engagement around patterns (office hours, "pattern of the month", etc)

## Last Committer Addition

*When was the last committer added to the project? A healthy project tends to add new committers regularly. The report should indicate the most recent date on which a committer was added.*

* [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* [@robtuley](https://github.com/robtuley) (added 2022-02-15)

## Committer Diversity

*Cover committer diversity in your project. A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. What are your steps to make sure that people from all regions on the globe can participate in your project without having to be awake at midnight their local time?*

- we got [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) in Japan now :)
- could benefit from more activity in the US
