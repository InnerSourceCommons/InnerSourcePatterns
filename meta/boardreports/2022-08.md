#### Overview

- Japanese Patterns translation
    - Mature patterns were translated to [Japanese](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/v/jp/) and published as part of our book. yay!
    - we now have the infrastructure/tooling to translate our patterns to other languages - Chinese anybody?
- [Yuki Hattori](https://github.com/yuhattor) joined as Trusted Committer - yay! (he drove the JP translation effort). He has collected an enthusiastic crowd to push the Japanese InnerSource Community forward.
- +47% page views on our [patterns book][book]
    - ~12.100 page views total (last 8.200)
    - ~134 per day

#### Future Goals

- help the Japanese InnerSource Community to channel new patterns into our repo (in English + Japanese)

*below same as in previous report*

- reduce the time that PRs stay in review
- reduce the time it takes from posting a pattern idea to opening a first PR (lower the barrier for entry)
- actively reaching out to orgs that already talk about their InnerSource work publicly. Help them to contribute their patterns. => see [Patterns in the Wild][2022-05 report]
- hardening the patterns further, by finding 3 known instances for some of the patterns in the book (improves quality and increases trustworthiness of the patterns) => see [Known Instances Collection][2022-05 report]
- level-up more patterns from the GitHub repo to the book (i.e. from Level 1 to Level 2). The patterns in the book seem to get more exposure.
- trying out other ways to make the patterns easier to discover (e.g. different pattern categories; index pages at the end of the book or similar)
- try out other forms of engagement around patterns (office hours, "pattern of the month", etc)

#### Last Committer Addition[^1]

* [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* [@robtuley](https://github.com/robtuley) (added 2022-02-15)

#### Committer Diversity[^2]

- we got [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) in Japan now :)
- could benefit from more activity in the US

#### Challenges & Questions to the Board

- Process for making an `innersourcecommons.org` DNS change is unclear (Daniel is working on that)
- Would be great to get a status update from the Japanese InnerSource Community in a couple of months. How are hey are doing? How we can support them? => Sebastian is offering to be the "Board contact" for them.

[^1]: When was the last committer added to the project? A healthy project tends to add new committers regularly. The report should indicate the most recent date on which a committer was added.
[^2]: Cover committer diversity in your project. A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. What are your steps to make sure that people from all regions on the globe can participate in your project without having to be awake at midnight their local time?
