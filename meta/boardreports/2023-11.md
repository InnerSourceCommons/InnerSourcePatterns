## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns][] repository:

* new pattern [Standard Release Process](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/releases/tag/v1.6) - thank you **@dgrizzanti**
* translation to [Brazilian Portuguese](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/releases/tag/v1.7) - Thanks to the very awesome **@jrcosta @zilio @DanielleAlmeida** that made this happen.
* additions of Known Instances (applications of our patterns in the wild)
  * ADI to innersource-customer-interview-questions.md (initial pattern)
  * GitHub to [Standard Release Process](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/release-process)
*  experimenting with various tools to understand the contribution patterns of our community better. e.g. see [these stats](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/625) - shout outs to **@zkoppert** not only for building these tools but also for helping us to integrate them into our repo  
*  added a **welcome bot** to our repo, that greats new contributors and points them to helpful info about our contribution process - see [this example](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/573)
* by using gitbook's "monorepo approach", we are now able to deploying multiple translations in parallel via gitbook a lot easier 
* added a new `COMMUNICATION-template.md` to streamline the communication to the **Standard Base Documentation** pattern. - thank you **@kschueths**

## Things to come

* Toying with the idea to add [Adopters pages](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns-staging/v/adopters-test/adopters/adopters) to our book. Goal: showcase the organizations and the patterns they use more prominently in our book. Looking for feedback! More [details here](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/623).
* Galician translation (released in 11/2023 therefore not part of this report yet)
* hoping to integrate further PRs that were contributed some time back but we did not have time to review them properly (or the communication stopped somewhere)
  * pattern proposal [Feature Owner](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/573) by Manoj Gawande (@magawande) from Fidelty (part of FINOS?) - new contributor!
  * proposal to add a [Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/556) to the **Standard Base Documentation** pattern - by Jose Roman Martin Gil (@rmarting) from Red Hat - new contributor?

## Trusted Committers (Community)

* Last [Trusted Committer][] added was [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* Trusted Committer candidates in the pipeline: No
* However fuelled by the translation process we have a couple of people that are taking ownership of keeping the translations in sync with the original patterns. Some of these [translation leads](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/TRUSTED-COMMITTERS.md#translation-leads) might turn into Trusted Committers in the future.

## Next Goals
