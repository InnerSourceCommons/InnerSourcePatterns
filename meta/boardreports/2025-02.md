## Engagement

The [patterns book][] is the way InnerSource practices are captured and shared. Recent web analytics:

* total traffic on the patterns book (tracking_id: `G-QL1S8MW5D9`)
  * 14,592 views total (prev 14,308)
  * 1,784 users (prev 1,908)
* Most popular patterns:
  * InnerSource Portal 
  * 30 Day Warranty
  * Maturity Model
  * Standard Base Documentation
  * Core Team
* traffic for translations:
  * Japanese (/ja) - 2163 (prev 1300)
  * Chinese (/zh) - 597 (prev 305)
  * Brazilian Portuguese (/pt-br) - 418 (prev 332)
  * Galician (/gl) - 101 (prev 46)
  * English (/) - roughly 11,313
* interpretations
  * Of our translated content, the Japanese patterns are consumed the most. Great to see that the content provides value to users in that geo/language.
  * Year over year the total views are down quite a bit. not sure why. (see reports from 2023)

## Things to come

* [Creating a plan](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/772) to get more patterns published in the book / spoiler: we have 6 patterns that could do that in the medium term. Need more hands though to make this happen. Fun fact: this activity was triggered by the ISPO WG asking about patterns were not published in the book yet, but somehow they knew existed :)
* Micaela Eller (from the ISPO WG) offered to help with leveling up further patterns. Will onboard her in the coming weeks. 
* [A proposal](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/777) was made to translate the patterns to Spanish. yay!
* I (@spier) used a [Kanban style board](https://github.com/orgs/InnerSourceCommons/projects/32) more rigurously in the last few months. It did help me figure out where I should invest my time to move patterns/issues/prs through the process and get them published to our repo.

* Some PRs are stuck. Reason is mostly that I (@spier) have less time to review things or communication with the contributor stopped somewhere.

## Trusted Committers (Community)

* Last [Trusted Committer][] added was [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* Trusted Committer candidates in the pipeline: No
* Finding new contributors and further trusted committers continues to be the main challenge of the InnerSource Patterns project
