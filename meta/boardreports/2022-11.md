# Patterns Board Report (Nov)

## Meta

* Reporting Period: August 1st, 2022 - October 31st, 2022
* [merged PRs](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pulls?q=is%3Apr+closed%3A2022-08-01..2022-10-31+is%3Amerged)
* [opened issues](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2022-08-01..2022-10-31+is%3Aopen+)

## Engagement

The [patterns book] is the way inner source practices are captured and shared. Recent web analytics:

* TODO: general trend in traffic (up/down?)
* TODO: top 3 most popular patterns are? Did pattern of the month have any noticeable effect here?  
* The Japanese version of the site has had 700 page views since its release and 450 unique users (as of November 2022). We need more page views in the future. Currently, many GitBook contents are not listed in Japanese search results. It must be search engine optimized.

## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns] repository:

* Sebastian Spier has been very active with various fixes and updates as usual!
* First-time contribution guide updated for hacktoberfest.
* New pattern "[Extensions to Manage Contributions at Scale](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/444/)"
* Various minor updates to existing patterns.

## Next Goals

* Clear down pending PRs?
* Expand the content in the book to include more existing but less mature patterns?
