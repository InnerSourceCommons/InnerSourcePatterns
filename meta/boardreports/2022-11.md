# Patterns Board Report (Nov)

## Engagement

The [patterns book] is the way inner source practices are captured and shared. Recent web analytics:

* TODO: general trend in traffic (up/down?)
* TODO: top 3 most popular patterns are? Did pattern of the month have any noticeable effect here?  
* TODO: any insights from jp language traffic?

## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns] repository:

* Sebastian Spier hs been very active with various fixes and updates as usual!
* First-time contribution guide updated for hacktoberfest.
* New pattern "[Extensions to Manage Contributions at Scale](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/444/)"
* Various minor updates to existing patterns.

## Next Goals

* Clear down pending PRs?
* Expand the content in the book to include more existing but less mature patterns?
