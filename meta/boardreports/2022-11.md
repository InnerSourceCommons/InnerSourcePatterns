# InnerSource Patterns WG - Report for Board Meeting 2022-11

## Meta

* Reporting Period: August 1st, 2022 - October 31st, 2022
* [merged PRs](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pulls?q=is%3Apr+closed%3A2022-08-01..2022-10-31+is%3Amerged)
* [opened issues](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2022-08-01..2022-10-31+is%3Aopen+)

## Engagement

The [patterns book] is the way InnerSource practices are captured and shared. Recent web analytics:

* Minor traffic increase (4%) on the patterns book
  * 12,627 page views total (previous report was 12,099)
  * ~140 per day
* Most popular patterns are:
  * InnerSource Portal (6.5% of total traffic)
  * 30 Day Warranty (4.5%)
  * Standard Base Documentation (4%) // Core Team (4%)
* The inclusion of a given pattern in the Marketing Newsletters don't seem to have a significant effect on the performance (readership) of those patterns. More thorough analytics could be done here to confirm this.
* The Japanese version of the site has had 700 page views since its release and 450 unique users (as of November 2022). We need more page views in the future. Currently, many GitBook contents are not listed in Japanese search results. It must be search engine optimized.

## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns] repository:

* Sebastian Spier has been very active with various fixes and updates as usual!
* First-time contribution guide updated for hacktoberfest.
* 2 new patterns:
   * [Extensions to Manage Contributions at Scale](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/444/)
   * [Transitioning Contractor Code to InnerSource Model](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/377)
* Various minor updates to existing patterns.

## Next Goals

The overall goals of this group are:

1. Increase number of people consuming the patterns. ("easier to discover", pattern of month, categories)
2. Increase the number and quality of patterns.
   1. Increase the number of people thinking to contribute. ("patterns in wild", "known instances")
   2. Increase probability of successful contribution. ("reduce review time", "lower barrier of entry")
   3. Optimise the existing content. (level-up more patterns, "known instances" again)

All goals will be progressed but we are prioritising effort towards 2.iii.

Specifically we want to get existing **Initial (L1)** patterns improved to **Structured (L2)**, so that we can publish them in the book.

We had a [discussion](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/486#discussion_r1029921121) about this and created a short-list of those patterns (details below).

### Shortlisted Patterns

Here you find more detail about the possible execution of this approach.
It is more information than what the Board needs. It may however help you to understand how we are reasoning about our patterns.

We identified these patterns as "low-hanging fruits", as they contain a **Known Instance** already, and that info is often hard to get.

We believe we can contact the respective authors/organizations, and ask them to review the patterns against the [Structured (L2) Requirements](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/contributor-handbook.md#requirements-level-2---structured). The upside for those orgs is to get their pattern (and brand) published in our book.

We expect that with one round of review (or rather a single PR) we can get these patterns published in our book.

* (IBM) [extensions-to-manage-contributions-at-scale.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/extensions-to-manage-contributions-at-scale.md) - We kept this pattern in Initial to give the community time to review/harden this pattern before it goes into the book.
* (Comcast) [release-process.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/release-process.md) - We kept this pattern in Initial to give the community time to review/harden this pattern before it goes into the book.
* (Flutter, Europace) [governance-levels.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/governance-levels.md) - Proposed by Europace (Isabel) but further improved by Rob.
* (??? Tim Yao, Georg Gr√ºtter) [contained-innersource.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/contained-innersource.md) - This pattern has been around for a long time. It can try to contact the two authors and see if they want to bring it over the finish line.
* (Philips) [source-code-inventory.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/source-code-inventory.md)
* (Philips, Verizon) [balancing-openness-and-security.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/balancing-openness-and-security.md)
* (GitHub) [transitioning-contractor-code-to-innersource-model.md](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/transitioning-contractor-code-to-innersource-model.md)
