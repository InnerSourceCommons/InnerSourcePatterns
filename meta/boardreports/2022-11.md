# Patterns Board Report - for Board Meeting 2022-11

## Meta

* Reporting Period: August 1st, 2022 - October 31st, 2022
* [merged PRs](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pulls?q=is%3Apr+closed%3A2022-08-01..2022-10-31+is%3Amerged)
* [opened issues](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+created%3A2022-08-01..2022-10-31+is%3Aopen+)

## Engagement

The [patterns book] is the way inner source practices are captured and shared. Recent web analytics:

* Minor traffic increase (4%) on the patterns book
   * 12,627 page views total (previous report was 12,099)
   * ~140 per day
* Most popular patterns are:
  * InnerSource Portal (6.5% of total traffic)
  * 30 Day Warranty (4.5%)
  * Standard Base Documentation (4%) // Core Team (4%)
* The inclusion of a given pattern in the Marketing Newsletters don't seem to have a significant effect on the performance (readership) of those patterns. More thorough analytics could be done here to confirm this.
* The Japanese version of the site has had 700 page views since its release and 450 unique users (as of November 2022). We need more page views in the future. Currently, many GitBook contents are not listed in Japanese search results. It must be search engine optimized.

## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns] repository:

* Sebastian Spier has been very active with various fixes and updates as usual!
* First-time contribution guide updated for hacktoberfest.
* 2 new patterns:
   * [Extensions to Manage Contributions at Scale](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/444/)
   * [Transitioning Contractor Code to InnerSource Model](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/377)
* Various minor updates to existing patterns.

## Next Goals

The overall goals of this group are:

1. Increase number of people consuming the patterns.
2. Increase the number of patterns.
    * Increase the number of people thinking to contribute.
    * Increase probability of successful contribution.
    * Optimise the existing content.

All will be progressed but prioritising effort towards XXX is expected to be of greatest impact.
