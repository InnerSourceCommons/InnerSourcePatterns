# Creating a Board Report for the Patterns WG

The Patterns Working Group is expected to submit a report to the Board of the InnerSource Commons Foundation on a quarterly basis.

This folder contains all reports that the Patterns Working Group has created.

More about the purpose and process is available in the [Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/foundation/blob/master/projects/reporting-guidelines.md).[^1]

## How to create a report

To create new Board report, copy the last report in this repo (e.g. [2022-08.md](2022-08.md)) to a new file.[^2]

The file should be named according the date of the Board meeting e.g. if the Board meeting is happening in April 2023, your file would be named `2023-04.md`.

Then edit that file with relevant information about the reporting period for which you are creating your report.

As guidance of what content to put into the report, take a look at the content of the previous report (which you already have in you file anyhow, as you copied it).

If you are unsure about anything, you can always ask the other Trusted Committers.

## Get feedback from the Working Group

Once you have a draft of your report, create a PR in this repo.

That allows you to get feedback from the other Trusted Committers (and potentially the wider Patterns community).

## Submitting the report

Once your report is ready, submit it to the Board via a PR to the [last Board meeting agenda file](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/foundation/blob/master/board/meeting)[^1].
