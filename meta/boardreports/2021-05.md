# InnerSource Patterns WG - Report for Governance Meeting 2021-05

## Reporting Period

February 1st - May 15th, 2021

## Mission

*Briefly describe what your project actually does.*

- Discuss community InnerSource practices and dynamics, collect and document agreed upon best practices of how to do InnerSource - in the form of patterns
- Continuously publish the most mature patterns as an ebook and website

## Overview

- the [patterns book](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/) has lead to various content improvements. gitbook's "Edit on GitHub" feature seems to make this easier for some contributors.
- patterns get referenced regularly in Slack, especially in #general discussions about InnerSource
- 3 new patterns + 7 new contributors (see below)
- switched to using the `main` branch terminology (instead of `master`)
- gitbook [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GitBookIO/status/1390698860708728836) about our book :)
- office hours run by Mishari (I believe?) / at least 1 person was asking about these in Slack as well.

## New Patterns

- [Unified Source Code Inventory](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/source-code-inventory.md) by David Terol from Philips (new contributor)
- [Good First Project](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/good-first-project.md) by Tapajit Dey / Brian Fitzgerald (new contributors)
- [InnerSource Guidance Group](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/patterns/1-initial/innersource-guidance-group.md) by Isabel - thank you for continuously pushing discoveries from Europace into the Patterns format

## Improving the book

- [Active voice and typos](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/295) by Doron Katz (new contributor)
- various spelling fixes by Alexander Andrade (new contributor) - not merged yet
- typo fix by [@arlou](https://github.com/arlou) (new contributor)
- removing a duplicate paragraph by Daniela Zheleva (new contributor)
- cleaning up a bunch of old PRs (only 3 left from 2018/2017)

## Future goals

- hardening the patterns further, by finding 3 known instances for some of the patterns in the book (improves quality and increases trustworthiness of the patterns)
- level-up more patterns from the GitHub repo to the book. The patterns in the book seem to get more exposure to interested readers.
- trying out other ways to make the patterns easier to discover (e.g. different pattern categories; index pages at the end of the book or similar)
- analytics capabilities for the book, so that we can learn which patterns are most relevant (built-in analytics on gitbook.io are not sufficient)
- try out other forms of engagement around patterns (office hours, "pattern of the month", etc)

## Last Committer Addition

*When was the last committer added to the project? A healthy project tends to add new committers regularly. The report should indicate the most recent date on which a committer was added.*

**Status: no changes/updates since last report**

- 11th of December 2020: @spier
- 24th of April 2020: @lenucksi

## Committer Diversity

*Cover committer diversity in your project. A healthy project should survive the departure of any single contributor or employer of contributors. What are your steps to make sure that people from all regions on the globe can participate in your project without having to be awake at midnight their local time?*

- Focus on asynchronous collaboration in the #innersource-patterns channel and in the GitHub repo
- Offering office hours on APAC and EU/Americas time slots (@mishari has started to help with the APAC one, also looking to organize a meetup potentially)
- Work towards automation of administration tasks, documentation of processes
- Have Trusted Committers in multiple time zones
