## Engagement

The [patterns book][] is the way InnerSource practices are captured and shared. Recent web analytics:

* total traffic on the patterns book (tracking_id: `G-QL1S8MW5D9`)
  * 14,308 views total (prev 15,021)
  * 1,908 users (prev 1,897)
* Most popular patterns:
  * 30 Day Warranty
  * Core Team
  * Maturity Model
  * Standard Base Documentation
  * InnerSource Portal
* traffic for translations:
  * Japanese (/v/ja) - 1300 (prev no data in Google Analytics)
  * Chinese (/v/zh) - 305 (prev 545)
  * Brazilian Portuguese (/v/pt-br) - 332 (prev 358)
  * Galician (/v/gl) - 46 (prev 68)
  * English (/) - roughly 12,300 (14,308 - sum of translation views above)
* interpretations
  * Of our translated content, the Japanese patterns are consumed the most (almost 10% of our total views). Great to see that the content provides value to users in that geo/language.
  * Year over year the total views are down quite a bit. not sure why. (see reports from 2023)

## Changes

Changes are contributed via the [InnerSourcePatterns][] repository:

  * [fixed link to bazaar plugin](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/711) / thanks @khola

## Things to come

* We would like to do one round of cleanup of old PRs/issues that are unlikely to still be implemented as they are stale for too long.
* (still) Toying with the idea to add [Adopters pages](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns-staging/v/adopters-test/adopters/adopters) to our book. Goal: showcase the organizations and the patterns they use more prominently in our book. Looking for feedback! More [details here](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/issues/623).
* Some PRs are stuck. Reason is mostly that I (@spier) have less time to review things or communication with the contributor stopped somewhere.

## Trusted Committers (Community)

* Last [Trusted Committer][] added was [@yuhattor](https://github.com/yuhattor) (added 2022-07-21)
* Trusted Committer candidates in the pipeline: No
* Finding new contributors and further trusted committers continues to be the main challenge of the InnerSource Patterns project
