# Creating InnerSource Pattern Drafts with AI

Our AI friends can help us to brainstorm and write new InnerSource patterns.
Usual precaution should apply, as always with AI ;)

Below we share various prompts and instructions for different API tools.

## ChatGPT

Paste this prompt into ChatGPT, and add a description of the problem you are looking to solve, as well as the intended solution.
Then populate the missing sections manually as you see fit.

You might also want to add an instruction to offer the answer directly as a markdown file.

```
I want to write a new InnerSource Pattern.

The pattern needs to follow this template:
https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/pattern-template.md

Further instructions:
- The headlines in the resulting pattern should be exactly the ones used in the template, and in the same order as in the template.
- Leave the following sections empty: Known Instances, Status, Author, Related Patterns

This is the concept that I want to explain in the pattern:

<describe the problem and intended solution here in rough terms>
```
