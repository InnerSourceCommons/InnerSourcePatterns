# InnerSource Patterns FAQ

This is a list of frequently asked questions about InnerSource Patterns.

## What are the different parts of a pattern? What do they mean?

* See the [pattern template](pattern-template.md)

## Why use a patterns approach to InnerSource?

* It abstracts information from known instances of proven solutions so that other people/companies can understand not only what was done by why it worked and how to adapt it to their own situations.

## How do you use the pattern?

* Each organization has its own history (*context*) and culture (a source of *forces*) and even goals, so using a pattern to solve their problems will generally require adaptation of that pattern. Try to identify things about your situation that are unique and apply those as makes sense to the *Context* and *Forces* identified in the pattern. See if these additional constraints might require changes to the *Solution* to ensure that the pattern will work.
* Patterns can also be used as a short-hand when discussing InnerSource programs across organizational boundaries.

## I'd like to consult with the IS Patterns community; do I need to have participating members sign NDAs?

* The vast majority of IS Patterns meetings and all conversations in the InnerSource Commons [Slack](https://isc-inviter.herokuapp.com/) are held under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule) that should provide sufficient protection to enable a productive discussion.
