# SAP

These are the InnerSource Patterns that **SAP** has adopted:

* [Repository Activity Score](../patterns/2-structured/repository-activity-score.md)
* [InnerSource Portal](../patterns/2-structured/innersource-portal.md)
* [Gig Marketplace](../patterns/2-structured/gig-marketplace.md)

If you work at **SAP** and want to modify the list above, go to pattern that you are using, and add **SAP** to **Known Instances** section.
Use the 'Edit on GitHub' functionality to do this.
Once the Pull Request with your changes has been merged, the list above will update automatically.
