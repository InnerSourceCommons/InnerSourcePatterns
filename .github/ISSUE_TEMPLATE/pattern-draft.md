This is the most basic template for a new pattern.
See our full pattern syntax [here](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/main/meta/pattern-template.md).

## Title

Short Title Here

## Patlet / Summary

Concise 1-2 sentence description of the problem and solution.

## Problem

What is the problem - crisp definition of the problem.
Short description, usually not more than a couple sentences, that describes what the issues and challenges are.
Be careful not to morph into information found in other sections below.

## Context

Where does the problem exist?
What are the pre-conditions?
**Unchangeable** before the solution goes into place.
The content here is often tied to the applicability of the pattern for other readers: "Do I have this same particular situation?"

## Forces

What makes the problem difficult?
What are the trade-offs?
These are constraints that **can be changed** at a cost.
The solution might change one or more of these forces in order to solve the problem, while also in-turn changing the context.

## Solutions

Verified resolutions and possible resolutions to the problem.

## Resulting Context

What is the situation after the problem has been solved?
The original context is changed indirectly by way of the solution.
Often this section can include discussion of the next possible Patterns/problems introduced.
This section can be short in content - the solution may not introduce new problems or change much context.

## Known Instances (optional)

Where has this been seen before?
Helps to reinforce that this is a REAL pattern and that you match the context.

May mention:

* A particular business
* Anonymized instances ex: "3 companies have proven that this is a good solution" or "A large financial services org...".

## Status 

Initial

## Author(s) (optional)

Often, this is yourself.
If you need to, find someone in the InnerSource Commons to be the nominal author (As Told To).
Could also be no-one if you do not want to take on authorship (common with a donut looking for a solution).
