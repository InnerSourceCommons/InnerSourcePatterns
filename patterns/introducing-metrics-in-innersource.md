## Title

Introducing Metrics in InnerSource

## Patlet

Many InnerSource projects find themselves struggling to quantify impact to upper management. By introducing a common metrics strategy team member can understand and explain the project's impact.

## Problem

Data is necessary to understand how the initiative is evolving, and if this is evolving according to certain expectations. In the first place, data helps measure where we are at this point in time at certain levels such as collaboration or development velocity. And this is helpful to see where we come from and set up goals to check where we’ll be in the near future.

## Forces

Against: 
Reluctancy of the teams to be measured.
In favor:
Upper management needs metrics to understand how the initiative is working

## Solutions

Work on a common metrics strategy. List the metrics at the level of teams (avoid individual tracking) and bring everyone into this conversation. Everyone should understand why a given metric is important and how this is measured across teams with specific documentation.

## Resulting Context
There is a generic metrics strategy in place. Teams understand this is needed and they add their own point of view to this.
