## Title

Culture Change through Hiring

## Patlet

TBD

## Problem

Getting any sort of ground swell behind an InnerSource project or program is hard when very few people in the company have experienced and internalized the InnerSource ways of working.

While training existing staff is often part of an InnerSource program, it does take a long time to get to a critical mass of people with hands-own experience in InnerSource.

The problem is made harder by a lack of collaboration between Engineering and the Recruitment team (HR), as InnerSource or Open Source skills aren't part of the interview process nor the personal development process of the employees.

## Context

> Where does the problem exist? What are the pre-conditions? **Unchangeable** before the solution goes into place. The content here is often tied to the applicability of the pattern for other readers: "Do I have this same particular situation?"

* Engineering and HR collaborate when hiring new engineers
* Work done on InnerSource was not part of official performance review because HR was not on board.
* some InnerSource projects are already happening but HR is not aware of those projects or considering the required InnerSource skills while recruiting.

## Forces

> What makes the problem difficult? What are the trade-offs? These are constraints that **can be changed** at a cost. The solution might change one or more of these forces in order to solve the problem, while also in-turn changing the context.

* InnerSource projects have a hard time finding employees who already know InnerSource or Open Source methodologies.
* InnerSource as a concept is not well known

## Solutions

* Engineering and HR make a concerted effort to identify the skills that they want to recruit for in new employees and train the existing staff in
* A handful of key-hires need to be identified, to act as evangelists for the InnerSource way of working
* ...

## Resulting Context

* InnerSource intentionally looped in during all HR interactions.
* Engineering is looping in HR both in recruiting and retention phase of employee engagement.

## Appendix

These are notes from the old pattern that we can work into the pattern structure above, if possible. Otherwise we will delete these when the PR gets merged.

### Benefits

* InnerSource can be a selling point for a company
* InnerSource is going, but we are not intentionally leveraging in HR strategy.
* 10% time is not taken up and used; sometimes culture is only taken up by hiring the right people

### Notes

* Ramping up InnerSource; semi-existent
* On-boarding guidelines
* HR is affected by InnerSource
  * Problem: How to sustain the InnerSource culture, even once new hires come in. How to keep existing employees who support and encourage InnerSource? Filling the ranks with new InnerSource-friendly and InnerSource-excited hires can be difficult.
* Company perception is drab and boring engineering culture; large company
  * Company is not attractive, or people are leaving, or hiring is difficult.
  * Company has trouble attracting developers who are interested in open source and InnerSource.
* Keep everyone updated on how the communities work, both from culture and technology perspective.
