## Title  

Contained InnerSource

## Patlet

Apply InnerSource methods to facilitate collaboration in a cross divisional
project but don't invest in soliciting contributions from outside of that
project.

## Problem  

Traditional development practices do not work as effectively for cross
divisional projects as do InnerSource style practices. However, Management
does not support adopting InnerSource practices because it regards efforts for
soliciting and facilitating contributions from outside of the project as
detrimental for the required efficiency.

## Context

* The company plans to develop a new software intensive product; multiple
  business units are involved in the development of this product
* There is not one single BU which has the required resources or knowledge
  to do the development on its own.
* An InnerSource program and required tools exist.
* The InnerSource program advocates using the full spectrum of InnerSource
  practices (_Full Scale InnerSource_).

## Forces  

* The product's importance to company revenue and the committed feature content
  and dates require a development paradigm that provides known, stable
  development resources (headcount).
* _Full scale InnerSource_ includes substantial effort for soliciting and
   managing contributions as well as onboarding new contributors, which is
   hard to plan for and my have some effect on the ability to control the
   timeline for completion and deployment.

## Solution

The BUs involved in the development of the new product each dedicate
development resources develop the new product, apply the InnerSource working
model and adopt InnerSource tooling to facilitate collaborative development but
limit the scope of InnerSource practices to the project. No effort will be
spent on facilitating and managing contributions from outside of the project.
The application of InnerSource is _contained_ to the project. The project may
but is not required to share the developed artefacts outside of the project.

## Resulting Context

_Contained InnerSource_ effectively allows and facilitates the
development collaboration of multiple BUs where existing traditional
development infrastructure and processes would not have worked efficiently.

Product development can be successfully completed. Even though _full scale
InnerSource_ was not implemented and the full benefits from InnerSource
practices, such as exemplary documentation which facilitates reuse beyond the
project context, are not realized, the projects success still lends credibility
to the concept of InnerSource.
