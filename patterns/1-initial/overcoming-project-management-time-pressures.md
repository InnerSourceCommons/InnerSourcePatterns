## Title

Time Constraints Hamper InnerSource Progress  

## Patlet

Project management believes timeline pressure and commitments on feature content does not allow for developers to spend the time needed to develop shareable code and provide support.

## Problem

Project management believes that timeline pressures and feature content commitments do not allow Developers to spend the time needed to develop shareable, reusable code and provide support. As a result, there is currently no code available for reuse, and Developers are writing redundant code.

## Context

Customer deadlines and delivery commitments for feature content do not change.  

## Forces

❎ Aggressive roadmaps for delivery

❎ Project management concern that engagement will lead to missed deadlines

❎ Project management concern that Code contribution and/or mentoring may lead to dilution of subject matter expert time spent on their own projects (other teams may require their time).

✔️ Elimination of rewriting common code saves time (write once, use many times)

✔️ Crowd-based testing and debugging saves time (and improves quality)

✔️ The collaboration and synergy of inner sourcing can generate new, innovative features

✔️ Test Driven Development could mitigate some of the above forces

## Solutions

- Known pattern: Temporary fork by product team, merging changes back later to component team
- Known anti-pattern: surreptitious temporary fork, no communication
- New Pattern: Pre-pull request (prior to release), to ensure component team has buy-in, to avoid breakage for temporary fork
- Allocate time into Development sprint/release schedules to allow for InnerSource
- Provide education to product owners and Development leads regarding time saving benefits of InnerSource

## Resulting Context

Time is allotted in the schedule for InnerSource. Less duplicative development due to availability of reusable code. (No negative impact on customer deadlines or content delivery commitments.)
