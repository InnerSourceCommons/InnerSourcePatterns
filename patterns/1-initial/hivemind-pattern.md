## Problem

In many organizations, there's an inherent pressure to present finished or near-finished ideas, which reduces the opportunity for collaborative input from a wider community. How can we encourage individuals to open up their ideas or challenges early for feedback, leveraging the collective intelligence of the community?

## Context

* Organizations where sharing early-stage ideas is not the norm.
* Environments where there's a fear of criticism or judgment for unfinished ideas.
* Cultures that prioritize individual achievement over collective collaboration.

## Forces

* **Inertia:** Employees often follow established cultural norms.
* **Lack of Awareness:** Some might not be aware of the benefits of tapping into the collective intelligence.
* **Fear of Criticism:** Sharing an unfinished idea can be daunting.
  
## Solution

* Create a safe space (like a specific repo, brainstorming channel) where employees can share unfinished ideas.
* Encourage opening (WIP or draft) PRs that are not fully complete but provide a starting point for discussion.
* Cultivate a community culture that values and rewards collaboration and feedback.
* Host regular "idea-sharing" sessions where team members can present their initial thoughts and get feedback.

## Resulting Context

* Enhanced collaboration and broader input on ideas.
* Reduction in duplicated efforts across the organization.
* Faster ideation to implementation timelines.
* Stronger sense of community and shared ownership of challenges and solutions.
