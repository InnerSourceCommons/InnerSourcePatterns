## Title

Outsourced Development Ecosystem

## Patlet

The burdens of existing contracts in an outsourced environment constrains the success of the
InnerSource initiative. Outsourced companies may see this as a risky situation as they have to
way to share knowledge, resources, and expertise with competitors within the mother company.
The legal contracts typically forces to develop software in a very specific and silo-ed way.
Redefining these rules and allowing outsourced companies would bring a more InnerSource-friendly
way of working.

## Problem

Current outsourced environments in large corporations prevent those suppliers to work in an
InnerSource way. This includes a transparent, collaborative, and community-oriented way.
Beyond the implications of the cultural change and process focus, most of the limitations are
given by the existing legal framework that forces the outsourced development to charge a fee
per hour and within a very specific project. There are not specific agreements to allow
a collaborative way of working across the organization and across outsourced companies or contractors.

## Context

Large corporation with a big variety of outsourced companies and contractors that produce part
of the code base of this company. Each company or contractor has its own contract in place
that states the goals, the pricing schema, and the expected outcome and output for the organization.

No collaboration happens at the outsourced company or contractor level and each of them are working
in a silo-based mode with no interactions with others, but the mother company.

## Forces

* Legal teams and outsourced companies trying to avoid risk exposure and responsibilities.
* Legal implications and responsibilities when something goes wrong.
* SLAs in place forcing behaviors.
* Managers losing control of the situation by having more collaboration across companies borders

## Solutions

* Governance model:
  * Better definition of who owns the code and the data produced and if possible owned by the
    mother company.
  * Definition of checks and balances of who is responsible for what action (RACI) and SLAs against PRs.
  * Definition of tools and processes so suppliers do not bring extra complexity to other suppliers.
* Flexibility in the legal contracts to allow them to contribute with other companies,
  even when they are competitors.
  *  Declaration of the supplier with other suppliers.
  *  Onboarding new suppliers.
  *  Relationship across developers.
  *  Budget management.
* Good practices should be enforced in the contracts with those companies or contractors.
  As an example:
  *  Good documentation practices.
  *  Code should be hosted in a collaborative platform every company and contractor is able to reach
     out to it
  *  State pull request / change request as the by-default way of working and communication.
  *  Avoid private developments and releases of tons of lines of code, keep a transparent way of
     across companies or contractors.
* Train the mother company POs to work with several suppliers within the same project.
* Define clear and fair guidelines across internal outsourced companies to avoid internal friction.
* Skill up your suppliers on InnerSource practices
* Resources discussions may be part of the conversation at some point, be sure to define the limitations
  of their interactions within other existing projects.

## Resulting Context

Outsourced companies and contractors are safe to collaborate with other competitors as collaboration
rules are clear, common processes and tools are in place, and the legal framework of each participant
allows to move into this direction.
