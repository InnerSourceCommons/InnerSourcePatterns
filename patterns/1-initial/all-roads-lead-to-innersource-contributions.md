From http://wiki.c2.com/?PatLet

## Problem

Projects are adopting InnerSource, but struggling to convert users, consumers or stakeholders into contributors, or forming a community.

In this context, the InnerSource Program is considered also an InnerSource Project.

## Story (optional)

TODO
Sometimes there is a story that helps people understand the pattern better.

## Context

Users of a service, library or application (software), as well as consumers of any kind of InnerSource content (e.g. documentation), are unaware of the InnerSource project behind the software or content, or even unaware of the InnerSource concept.

## Forces

Project maintainers do not see the conversion of users, consumers and interested parties into contributors as a user experience challenge that they need to solve.

Project maintainers are unaware that they potential contributors may not be familiar with InnerSource.

## Sketch (optional)

TODO
visual illustration

## Solutions

TODO
Verified resolutions and possible resolutions to the problem.

## Resulting Context

TODO
What is the situation after the problem has been solved?
The original context is changed indirectly by way of the solution.
Often this section can include discussion of the next possible Patterns/problems introduced.
This section can be short in content - the solution may not introduce new problems or change much context.

## Rationale (optional)

TODO
Explains why this is the right solution; using totally different words WHY this solution balances these forces and this context to solve this problem.
Can expand on what-if's or theories.

## Known Instances (optional)

TODO
Where has this been seen before?
Helps to reinforce that this is a REAL pattern and that you match the context.

May mention:

* A particular business
* Anonymized instances ex: "3 companies have proven that this is a good solution" or "A large financial services org...".
