## Problem

Projects are adopting InnerSource, but struggling to convert users, consumers or stakeholders into contributors, or community members.

In this context, the InnerSource Program is considered also an InnerSource Project.

## Story (optional)

TODO
Sometimes there is a story that helps people understand the pattern better.

## Context

Users of a service, library or application (software), as well as consumers of any kind of InnerSource content (e.g. documentation), are unaware of the InnerSource project behind the software or content, or even unaware of the InnerSource concept (i.e. they don't know they can contribute).

Potential community members and/or contributors have their first contact with the project through content that was not initially designed as a landing page for new comers, e.g. by finding pieces of the backlog, documents, repositories, presentations, etc... (touch points). These touch points can be reached, for instance, through an intranet corporate search.

InnerSource projects do not reach their full potential due to the lack of conversion of consumers into community members and/or contributors.

## Forces

Project maintainers do not see conversion of users, consumers and interested parties into contributors as a user experience/marketing challenge that they need to solve.

Project maintainers are unaware that their potential contributors may not be familiar with InnerSource.

## Sketch (optional)

TODO
visual illustration

## Solutions

Maintainers shall look at the journey from consumer to community member to contributor as a design problem.

In essence, that means putting themselves in the shoes of their consumers, and ensuring that there is a path to becoming a community member and/or contributor, starting at the most commons touch points.

Examples of commons consumer touch points:

- Search results in intranet corporate search 
- Documentation for consumers of applications, tools, services, reuse libraries, etc...
- Blog posts and videos promoting the project or serving as secondary documentation
- The project backlog (e.g. a project in Jira)
- The user interface of applications, tools and services

All such touch points should:

- State that the project is InnerSource
- Link to information about InnerSource (e.g. a beginner's guide)
- Have information, or link to information, on how to become a member of the project's community and/or become a project contributor 

If necessary, search engine optimization should be done to ensure that the project is well represented on the organization's intranet corporate search.

## Resulting Context

TODO
What is the situation after the problem has been solved?
The original context is changed indirectly by way of the solution.
Often this section can include discussion of the next possible Patterns/problems introduced.
This section can be short in content - the solution may not introduce new problems or change much context.

## Rationale (optional)

TODO
Explains why this is the right solution; using totally different words WHY this solution balances these forces and this context to solve this problem.
Can expand on what-if's or theories.

## Known Instances (optional)

TODO
Where has this been seen before?
Helps to reinforce that this is a REAL pattern and that you match the context.

May mention:

* A particular business
* Anonymized instances ex: "3 companies have proven that this is a good solution" or "A large financial services org...".

## Acknowledgments (optional)

TODO
Include those who assisted in helping with this pattern - both for attribution and for possible future follow up.
Though optional, most patterns should list who helped in their creation.

## Alias (optional)

TODO
If this pattern is also known under a different name than what is listed unter **Title**, please list those alternative titles here.
e.g. if the pattern is named after the problem it solves, a helpful alias might be one that describes the solution that is applied.
