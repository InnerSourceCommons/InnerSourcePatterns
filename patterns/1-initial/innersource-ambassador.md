## Title

InnerSource Ambassadors

## Patlet

When driving InnerSource adoption through a large, decentralized organization it is hard to understand and address the local challenges that come up in different departments and regions.
Local volunteers, called InnerSource Ambassadors, provide localized support by promoting InnerSource principles and acting as a communication bridge between their teams and the ISPO.

## Problem

The InnerSource Program Office (ISPO) cannot be everywhere at once within a large, decentralized organization. Without localized support, the ISPO struggles to understand the unique challenges and needs of different departments or regions and cannot effectively promote InnerSource practices across the organization.

## Story

In a multinational organization, the ISPO implemented InnerSource initiatives but noticed uneven adoption across departments. After appointing a local ambassador in one department, adoption rates improved as the ambassador tailored practices to the department's context and provided valuable feedback to the ISPO.

## Context

- The organization is large and has multiple independent departments.
- An ISPO has been established to drive InnerSource adoption.
- There is a need for consistent and tailored InnerSource implementation across diverse teams.
- Employees with a passion for collaboration and InnerSource principles are present within the organization.

## Forces

- **Geographical and organizational scale:** The ISPO cannot physically or logistically engage with every department.
- **Communication barriers:** Departments may have unique cultures and needs that are not immediately visible to the ISPO.
- **Workload balance:** Ambassadors must fulfill this role alongside their primary responsibilities.
- **Trust and credibility:** Ambassadors must be trusted by their teams and the ISPO.

## Solutions

- Identify and recruit volunteer ambassadors from across the organization who are enthusiastic about InnerSource. They support InnerSource goals while maintaining their primary organizational roles.
- Train ambassadors on InnerSource principles, tools, and the goals of the ISPO.
- Establish clear expectations for ambassadors, including acting as a liaison, promoting InnerSource practices, and providing feedback to the ISPO.
- Create a support network among ambassadors to share best practices and foster a sense of community.
- Schedule regular check-ins between ambassadors and the ISPO to gather insights and provide guidance.

## Resulting Context

- Localized InnerSource support increases adoption and effectiveness.
- The ISPO gains valuable, real-time feedback on challenges, successes, and opportunities within different departments.
- Ambassadors become advocates for InnerSource, fostering a culture of collaboration.
- Workload balancing remains a challenge, but most ambassadors find the role rewarding and career-enhancing.

## Rationale

InnerSource Ambassadors leverage their existing knowledge of their departments and relationships within the organization to address challenges the ISPO cannot solve alone. This decentralization of responsibility enhances the ISPO's reach while maintaining centralized oversight.
