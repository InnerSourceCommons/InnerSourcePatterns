Share Your Code to Get More Done

## Patlet

TBD

## Problem

* Developers do not realize that they can get more done by taking advantage of Inner Sourcing
* Developers continue to work in their silo or alone and never take the time invest in moving to Inner Sourcing
* Project Teams need a compelling reason to invest some time to make the change

## Context

* Development on a specific product is siloed and a finite number of developers are involved in development activity
* Development progress is not moving fast enough
* Developers are being asked to do more work than they can accomplish
* Other developers are likely to work on the product if the opportunity to participate existed
* Current developers are working near maximum efficiency

## Forces

* Developers have no extra time to shift to Inner Sourcing
* Management has not prioritized a shift to Inner Sourcing
* Adding staff to get the work done using traditional methods is not possible
* The value of Inner Sourcing is not included in the project plan

## Sketch (optional)

## Solution

* Leverage existing case studies and collateral from Inner Source Commons to educate management on the value of investing in Inner Sourcing.
* Work with planning team to document an alternative project plan with some inner sourcing activities and estimated benefits from realistic expected participation
* Move the product code to an Inner Source compatible solution and open the code
* Assign a portion of the developers time to work as reviewers to ensure inner sourcing activities are successful
* Recruit potential contributors and inform them of the availability of the opportunity to participate
* Align incentives to participation for both existing developers and contributors to encourage behavior

## Resulting Context

* Development previously done in a silo is on the inner source system
* People from outside the traditional silo are contributing successfully
* More development is getting done per period (sprint)
