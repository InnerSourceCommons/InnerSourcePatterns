Share Your Code to Get More Done

Old title: Share Your Code to Get More Done - Likely Contributors Variant

## Patlet

TBD

## Problem

- Developers do not realize that they can get more done by taking advantage of Inner Sourcing
- Developers continue to work in their silo or alone and never take the time invest in moving to Inner Sourcing
- Project Teams need a compelling reason to invest some time to make the change

## Context

- Development on a specific product is siloed and a finite number of developers are involved in development activity
- Development progress is not moving fast enough
- Developers are being asked to do more work than they can accomplish
- Other developers are likely to work on the product if the opportunity to participate existed
- Current developers are working near maximum efficiency

## Forces

- Developers have no extra time to shift to Inner Sourcing
- Management has not prioritized a shift to Inner Sourcing
- Adding staff to get the work done using traditional methods is not possible
- The value of Inner Sourcing is not included in the project plan

## Sketch (optional)

## Solution

- Leverage existing case studies and collateral from Inner Source Commons to educate management on the value of investing in Inner Sourcing.
- Work with planning team to document an alternative project plan with some inner sourcing activities and estimated benefits from realistic expected participation
- Move the product code to an Inner Source compatible solution and open the code
- Assign a portion of the developers time to work as reviewers to ensure inner sourcing activities are successful
- Recruit potential contributors and inform them of the availability of the opportunity to participate
- Align incentives to participation for both existing developers and contributors to encourage behavior

## Resulting Context

- Development previously done in a silo is on the inner source system
- People from outside the traditional silo are contributing successfully
- More development is getting done per period (sprint)
