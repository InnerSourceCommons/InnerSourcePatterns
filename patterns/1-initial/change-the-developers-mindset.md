## Title

Change the developers mindset

## Patlet

TBD

## Problem  

- Change developer mindset, it's difficult to push developers to do things.
- Developers are resisting the change, they are in their comfort zone and it's hard to go out.
- Developer organizations maturity is high, so people are used to being in some hierarchy/rules
- Developers are formed in agile, the shift from agile is difficult

## Context

- Top-down inner source support
- 3k population of developers
- Middle Management  is not supporting inner source
- There's already a successful group in the early stages
- Code visibility is product dependent

## Forces  

- Manager are previous developers, so they like the way they were promoted and they want to proceed in similar ways
- Manager restrict where developers can spend time on
- Top-down approach to the inner source
- Different teams within the company have to decide to proceed with inner source
- No formal training
- Processes are not clear

## Sketch (optional)

## Solution  

- Showing reward/recognition of the developer team
- Formalize training
- Clarify more processes
- Give middle management specific objectives to make inner source successful
- Listen to manager complaints and fears and count on them

## Resulting Context

- Use of the several projects across the several development teams
- Collaboration within the same developer team (mentorship and so on)

## Rationale (optional)

## Known Instances (optional)

## Status

- Initial
