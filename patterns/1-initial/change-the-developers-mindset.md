## Title

Change the developers mindset

## Patlet

TBD

## Problem  

* How do you change developer mindset? It's difficult to push developers to do things.
* Developers are resisting the change, they are in their comfort zone and it's hard to get them to go out of it.
* Developer organization's maturity is high, so people are used to being in some hierarchy/rules.
* Developers are formed in Agile, the shift from Agile is difficult.

## Context

* Top-down InnerSource support exists.
* 3k population of developers.
* Middle management is not supporting InnerSource.
* There is already a successful InnerSource group in the early stages.
* Code visibility is product dependent.

## Forces  

* Managers are previous developers, so they like the way they were promoted and they want to proceed in similar ways.
* Managers restrict what developers can spend time on, perhaps because of KPIs they have to meet and their belief in the best way to meet those.
* The approach to the InnerSource initiative is top down - it is supported by top management.
* Different teams within the company decide whether and how to proceed with InnerSource.
* No formal training exists.
* Processes are not clearly defined.

## Solution  

* Show reward/recognition of the developer team that is engaged in InnerSource.
* Formalize training.
* Clarify more processes.
* Give middle management specific objectives to make InnerSource successful.
* Listen to manager complaints and fears and counter them.

## Resulting Context

* Software from several InnerSource projects is used across the several development teams.
* There is improved collaboration within the same developer team (mentorship and so on).
