## Title

Migrating from InnerSource to Open Source

## Patlet

When an InnerSource project succeeds internally and meets criteria for external release, establish a process that addresses legal, security, governance, and community readiness to transition the project to open source while maintaining its internal value.

## Problem

Organizations with successful InnerSource projects may want to transition to open source but lack structured processes. Without proper planning, projects risk legal issues, security vulnerabilities, governance conflicts, and community challenges that could harm success and reputation.

## Story

A tech company developed a popular internal tool using InnerSource, achieving strong adoption and good documentation. When they open sourced it, they found corporate information in comments, unclear licenses, and no community processes. The rushed release caused legal issues, security risks, and overwhelmed maintainers struggling with external contributions.

## Context

This pattern applies when:

- An InnerSource project has achieved internal success and adoption.
- The organization has established InnerSource practices and governance.
- There is strategic value in releasing the project publicly.
- Legal and compliance frameworks are in place for open source releases.
- The project team has experience with collaborative development practices.
- External market demand or strategic positioning justifies open sourcing.

## Forces

- **Legal Complexity**: Existing code may contain proprietary information, unclear licensing, or patent concerns that must be resolved before public release
- **Security Exposure**: Internal security practices may not be suitable for public code, requiring a comprehensive security review
- **Governance Transition**: Internal governance structures may conflict with open source community expectations and meritocracy principles
- **Community Readiness**: Internal teams may lack experience managing external contributors and community dynamics
- **Resource Allocation**: Open source projects require ongoing maintenance and community support that may conflict with internal priorities
- **Brand and Reputation**: Public release represents the organization to external communities and may impact brand perception
- **Competitive Advantage**: Releasing code publicly may reduce competitive advantages while potentially increasing market influence
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Industry-specific regulations may impose additional requirements for public code releases

## Solutions

Establish a comprehensive migration process that includes:

1. **Pre-Migration Assessment**: Evaluate the project's readiness using established criteria, including adoption metrics, documentation quality, and community management capabilities

2. **Legal and Compliance Review**: 
   - Conduct a thorough code review to identify and remove proprietary information.
   - Establish clear licensing terms and intellectual property ownership.
   - Perform patent and copyright clearance.
   - Create legal documentation for external contributors.

3. **Security Hardening**:
   - Remove internal credentials, API keys, and sensitive configuration.
   - Implement security best practices suitable for public code.
   - Establish vulnerability disclosure processes.
   - Create security documentation and guidelines.

4. **Governance Structure Design**:
   - Define decision-making processes that balance internal needs with community input to ensure effective outcomes.
   - Establish maintainer roles and responsibilities.
   - Create contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
   - Design community management processes

5. **Community Preparation**:
   - Train maintainers on open source community management
   - Establish communication channels and documentation standards.
   - Create onboarding processes for external contributors.
   - Develop community engagement strategies.

6. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Migrate to public repositories with appropriate access controls.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines suitable for public development.
   - Establish issue tracking and project management tools.
   - Create public documentation and websites.

7. **Gradual Release Strategy**:
   - Start with limited external access or beta releases.
   - Gradually expand community participation.
   - Monitor adoption and community health metrics.
   - Adjust processes based on community feedback.

8. **Ongoing Support Framework**:
   - Establish maintenance and support processes.
   - Create escalation procedures for critical issues.
   - Define success metrics and review cycles.
   - Plan for long-term sustainability

## Resulting Context

After successful migration:

- The project gains external contributors and broader adoption.
- Internal teams develop open source community management skills.
- The organization builds a reputation within the open-source ecosystem.
- Legal and compliance frameworks are established for future open source releases.
- The project may require ongoing resource allocation for community management.
- Internal development processes may need to adapt to the needs of the external community.
- New opportunities for collaboration and innovation emerge through external partnerships.

## Rationale

Migrating from InnerSource to open source is a natural evolution for internal projects, but requires careful planning to avoid pitfalls. A structured approach addresses legal, security, and governance issues proactively. By building on InnerSource practices, organizations can leverage collaborative skills and adapt to external community challenges.

This migration strikes a balance between organizational needs and open-source community expectations, resulting in sustainable projects that benefit both. The gradual approach enables learning and adaptation while minimizing risks to the project and the organization.
