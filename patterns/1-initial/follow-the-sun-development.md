## Title

Follow the Sun Development

## Patlet

InnerSource projects with contributors across multiple timezones struggle with delayed feedback cycles, duplicated work, and contributor frustration from timezone barriers. By implementing "Follow the Sun" development practices with structured handoff protocols, comprehensive async documentation, and timezone-aware tooling, projects can maintain continuous momentum and inclusive global collaboration.

## Problem

InnerSource projects that span multiple timezones face significant collaboration challenges that reduce contribution velocity and contributor satisfaction. Contributors in different timezones experience long wait times for reviews, feedback, and guidance, leading to decreased engagement and project momentum.

## Story

A global technology company launched an InnerSource platform project with potential contributors from their offices in San Francisco, London, and Singapore. Initially, the project maintainers (based in San Francisco) would review contributions during their working hours, leaving contributors in other timezones waiting 12-16 hours for basic feedback. European contributors would submit pull requests before their weekend, only to find conflicts and questions on Monday morning that had been resolved by the US team during the weekend. Singapore-based developers felt excluded from architectural decisions that happened during US-Europe overlapping hours. After six months, 70% of contributions came from US timezones despite global talent availability.

## Context

- An InnerSource project has potential contributors across multiple timezones (3+ timezones spanning more than 12 hours)
- The project receives regular contributions and requires frequent collaboration between maintainers and contributors
- Traditional synchronous collaboration methods (meetings, real-time code reviews) create bottlenecks
- Contributors in non-primary timezones report feeling excluded or delayed in their contribution efforts
- The organization values global collaboration and wants to leverage distributed talent

## Forces

- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Balance**: Real-time collaboration provides immediate feedback and builds relationships, but creates timezone barriers. Pure async communication can lack nuance and slow decision-making.
- **Documentation Overhead vs. Efficiency**: Comprehensive async documentation takes time to create and maintain, but is essential for timezone handoffs and onboarding.
- **Local Autonomy vs. Global Consistency**: Giving timezone-specific teams decision-making authority improves speed, but can lead to inconsistent approaches across regions.
- **Inclusive Participation vs. Decision Speed**: Ensuring all timezones can contribute to important decisions takes longer but builds stronger global community.
- **Tooling Investment vs. Simplicity**: Timezone-aware tools and automation require upfront investment but significantly improve collaboration efficiency.

## Solutions

Implement a "Follow the Sun" development model that enables continuous project momentum through structured timezone handoffs:

### Core Practices

1. **Structured Handoff Protocol**
   - Create timezone-specific "shift notes" in project wikis or shared documents
   - Use standardized handoff templates that include: work completed, blockers encountered, decisions pending, and next priorities
   - Establish clear handoff times (e.g., end of each region's working day)
   - Designate timezone champions who coordinate handoffs and ensure continuity

2. **Async-First Documentation Standards**
   - All architectural decisions documented with context using [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](./document-architecture-decisions.md)
   - Code review comments include sufficient context for async response
   - Meeting recordings and transcripts published within 24 hours
   - Decision rationale captured in issue trackers, not just decisions themselves

3. **Timezone-Aware Processes**
   - Stagger regular project meetings across different timezone combinations
   - Use asynchronous RFC processes for major decisions with minimum 72-hour comment periods
   - Implement "follow-up reviews" where contributors from other timezones can add input after initial reviews
   - Create timezone-specific office hours for informal collaboration

4. **Global Maintainer Model**
   - Distribute [Trusted Committer](../2-structured/trusted-committer.md) roles across key timezones
   - Cross-train maintainers to avoid single points of failure in any timezone
   - Rotate "primary contact" responsibilities across timezones for different project areas

### Supporting Tools and Automation

- Configure CI/CD pipelines for all timezones with appropriate notification settings
- Use project dashboards that show current "active timezone" and relevant contacts
- Implement chatbots or automation that can provide basic project information 24/7
- Set up timezone-aware notification systems that respect local working hours

## Resulting Context

When successfully implemented, Follow the Sun development creates:

- **Continuous Project Momentum**: Work progresses around the clock as contributors in different timezones pick up where others left off
- **Increased Global Participation**: Contributors from all timezones feel valued and able to meaningfully participate
- **Improved Documentation Culture**: The necessity of async handoffs raises overall project documentation quality
- **Reduced Time-to-Market**: 24-hour development cycles can accelerate feature delivery
- **Enhanced Knowledge Distribution**: Cross-timezone collaboration spreads expertise across the global team

However, this approach also introduces new challenges:

- Higher coordination overhead and process complexity
- Increased documentation maintenance burden  
- Potential for miscommunication in handoffs
- Need for greater discipline in async communication practices

These challenges may lead to related patterns like "Timezone-Aware Project Governance" or "Cross-Cultural InnerSource Communication."

## Known Instances

*This is a gap we've identified - we need real-world validation. Consider organizations like Microsoft, IBM, SAP, or other global companies that likely face this challenge.*

**Potential validation areas to research:**

- Global open source projects (Kubernetes, React, etc.) that could provide analogous examples
- Enterprise software companies with global development teams
- Organizations that have documented "follow the sun" practices in traditional development
