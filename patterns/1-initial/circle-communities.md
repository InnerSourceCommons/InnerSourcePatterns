## Title

Circle Communities

## Patlet

InnerSource adoption is slow in organizations due to limited understanding, engagement, and contextual relevance. Circle Communities address this by fostering synchronous conversations that build connections, close knowledge gaps, and cultivate collaboration and continuous learning.

## Problem

Organizations face several challenges in building individual understanding around InnerSource and growing a stakeholder community. These challenges include:

- **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: Employees often struggle with relevance about InnerSource, hindering their learning process.
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Significant gaps exist between what individuals know and what they need to learn, making meaningful engagement difficult.
- **Engagement Issues**: Without predictable and structured opportunities for synchronous conversations, engagement and participation can be low.
- **Limited Expertise**: Organizations may lack confident and knowledgeable individuals to facilitate discussions and bridge knowledge gaps.
- **Lack of Local Support**: Teams often begin adopting InnerSource frameworks but lack support in their immediate environments to address challenges effectively, leading to stalled progress and frustration.

## Context

* **Scenario 1**: Few people with extensive InnerSource knowledge exist within your heavily siloed organization. The practice has struggled to build sustainable engagement as the culture is not hospitable to open collaboration and innovation.

* **Scenario 2**: Your organization is decentralized and often stakeholders are unaware of other projects or programs. InnerSource has struggled to get engagement as the culture is highly dispersed and segmented across the organization.

## Forces

* **Complexity of Understanding**: InnerSource concepts can feel abstract and challenging to contextualize.
* **Lack of Structured Engagement Opportunities**: Without formal or recurring spaces for discussions, participation is inconsistent.
* **Limited Access to Expertise**: Few knowledgeable individuals can consistently bridge gaps or act as facilitators.
* **Cultural Barriers**: Siloed or decentralized cultures resist open collaboration and innovation.

## Solutions

Circle Communities provide a collaborative forum for voluntary participation. They foster an environment of round-table equality, maximizing authenticity and diversity. Key elements of this solution include:

* **Semi-Dedicated Community Participation**: These communities include participation from deep-knowledge experts who proactively hold the space, ensuring discussions are constructive and aligned with InnerSource principles. These experts are prepared to address topics of interest to support attendees, particularly newcomers or those struggling to get started.
* **Flexible Meeting Flow**: Meetings are not prescriptive presentations. Instead, they provide a space for attendees to get moving or unstuck by addressing early curiosity or challenges. When no pressing issues arise, discussions focus on topics of shared interest guided by expert participants.
* **Agreed Meeting Agenda**: Each meetingâ€™s agenda is collaboratively decided by the group, ensuring productivity and relevance. In cases where consensus is not reached, decisions defer to the (semi-)dedicated leaders for guidance and facilitation.
* **Diversity of Participants**: Bringing together individuals with varied backgrounds, expertise, and expectations fosters richer discussions and innovation.
* **Safe Spaces for Expression**: Members feel safe to share their thoughts, experiences, and perspectives.
* **Regular Engagement**: Sustained participation is encouraged through regular meetings, which maintain momentum and build trust.
* **Effective Knowledge Sharing**: Mechanisms such as collaborative tools and social conventions promote sharing best practices and fostering continuous learning.

To nurture Circle Communities, implement these practices:

* **Define the Purpose**: Clearly articulate goals and align them with the organization's mission.
* **Establish Social Conventions**: Develop guidelines to promote respect, inclusivity, and open dialogue, evolving them over time.
* **Facilitate Regular Meetings**: Schedule consistent meetings for progress discussions, insight sharing, and collaborative problem-solving.
* **Rotate Leadership**: Encourage shared leadership to distribute responsibility and deepen member connections.
* **Leverage Collaborative Tools**: Use tools like Slack or GitHub to facilitate communication, documentation, and privacy-preserving insights sharing.
* **Foster Continuous Improvement**: Solicit regular feedback to refine the community's activities and structure.

## Resulting Context

Embracing this pattern helps InnerSource programs become vibrant, effective and sustainable. Participants will feel more connected and engaged, leading to increased knowledge sharing, innovation and collective growth.
