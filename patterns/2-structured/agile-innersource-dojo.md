## Title

Agile InnerSource Dojo

## Patlet

An Agile InnerSource Dojo is a community of practice where participants collaboratively create, share and refine content, tools and practices using InnerSource methodologies.  This fosters a culture of continuous learning, innovation and collective improvement.  It can be applied to various domains such as Agile / DevOps / DevSecOps practices, InnerSource methodologies, Systems Thinking exploration and or Mindset transformation.

## Problem

Establishing a sustainable, collaborative environment that ensures consistent and up-to-date content while engaging a diverse group of participants is challenging.  Variations in contributions, unclear objectives and maintaining momentum can hinder progress.

## Context

A dojo is a didactic participatory practice group, predicated on traditional martial arts dojo practices. It creates opportunities for participants to learn by doing (embodied learning), under supervision and guidance of others who have prior experience. The InnerSource Dojo is designed for organizations aiming to harness the power of InnerSource to increase potentials for transofrmation and innovation.  This setting brings together individuals from various backgrounds, expertise and roles to collaboratively work on shared goals, ensuring the learning journeys remain relevant, beneficial and peer supported.

## Forces

* **Diversity of Participants**: The Dojo involves individuals with different backgrounds, expertise and expectations.
* **Need for Safe Spaces**: Participants must feel safe to share their insights and challenges.
* **Continuous Engagement**: Ongoing participation is crucial for maintaining the Dojo's momentum and impact.
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Effective methods for sharing knowledge and best practices are essential.

## Solutions

Adopt a strategic approach to create and sustain an InnerSource Dojo, focusing on clear objectives, inclusive participation and continuous improvement.  This can be achieved through the following parallel efforts:

* **Define the Purpose**: Clearly articulate the Dojo's purpose and goals, ensuring alignment with broader organizational objectives.
* **Establish Social Conventions**: Develop and communicate social conventions that promote respect, inclusivity and open dialogue.  Encourage members to embrace and evolve these guidelines to create a safe and supportive environment.
* **Facilitate Regular Meetings**: Schedule regular meetings to maintain engagement and momentum.  Use these sessions for open discussions, sharing insights and addressing challenges.  Meetings are open for unpacking issues, with goals set by attendees.
* **Rotate Leadership**: Encourage shared leadership by rotating the facilitation role among members.  This helps distribute responsibility and fosters a sense of connection.
* **Use Collaborative Tools**: Utilize tools like Jitsi Meet, Slack and GitHub for communication and documentation.  Insights can be optionally shared on social channels, ensuring privacy.
* **Encourage Voluntary Code Contribution**: Foster an environment where contributions are voluntary, allowing individuals to work on what interests them and aligning with their passions.
* **Prioritized Mentorship**: Implement a mentorship structure with Sensei (teachers) providing guidance and Senpai (senior students) supporting newer members. This dual-layer mentorship enhances skill development and community cohesion.
* **Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement**: Regularly seek feedback to identify improvement areas, refining the Dojo's conditioning and activities accordingly.

## Resulting Context

Embracing this pattern helps InnerSource programs become vibrant, effective and sustainable.  Participants will feel more connected and engaged, leading to increased knowledge sharing, innovation and collective growth.
