## Title

Standard Release Process

## Patlet

Teams are reluctant to use InnerSource projects that they are unfamiliar with when they are unclear about the release process.
Providing clear release notes and a published artifact gives people confidence you are publishing a quality product.

## Problem

When a team is deciding whether to use an InnerSource project, one of their considerations is whether they trust that they can rely on the given project for an extended period. Switching the tools/projects that they are using has a cost, so they only want to make those investments sporadically.

InnerSource projects that don't have a published artifact or release process reduces trust. Teams won't know when they can expect the next release, when breaking changes are introduced, etc.

## Context

It is common practice in Open Source projects to have releases, with release notes documenting breaking changes, new features, etc along with either a published binary or link to a Docker image. This practice may not be as transparent or well documented/visible for InnerSource projects, modules, etc. Providing robust release notes along with a published artifact that is the result of a documented and visible release process builds trust and confidence in your project.

A lack of release notes and versioned, released binaries is very often an issue for internal projects. Teams get comfortable with the build process and internalize what goes into a release without showing the details. Any internal project with no pre-built binary or docker image available for external users fits this pattern. Without releasing often, providing clear documentation of what is included in the release, and providing an easy way to use the software, folks may shy away from using and contributing to your application or tool.

## Forces

### Difficult for organizations that don't have a central CI/CD system

For organizations that don't provide engineers a centralized CI/CD system, automating a build and release process can be challenging. The team may need to stand up their own tool (Jenkins, Drone, etc). Without a CI/CD system, builds and release notes can still be produced, however, it may require a local build of the software and manual upload to whichever tool is hosting build artifacts.

### Added burden of publishing release notes

In addition to building your source code, writing release notes can be tedious without the ability to auto-generate a list of git commits. This would be left for someone to do manually, in addition to writing more high level details on a release.

### Increased difficulty without a location to host artifacts

If a company does not provide a centralized location for storing build artifacts (jars, npm modules, etc.) and docker images, engineers may be left deciding for themselves where is appropriate to store versioned software. Tools like GitHub provide this for you, however, if a company is not using one of these popular tools, this could pose a burden.

## Solution

- CI/Delivery Pipeline is located within your repo to build artifacts (binary, docker image, jar, etc)
- Releases and accompanying build artifacts are generated by CI system at build time
- Release includes notes on New Features, Bug Fixes, and any "Breaking Changes" specifically called out

A good example of quality release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases).

## Resulting Context

Teams who come across your project will see published release notes and gain confidence in your tool. Published artifacts also make using your product easier and quicker to adopt. Having well-defined and visible processes such as these also help with cross-team collaboration and new contributors. Folks can be confident that their contributions are made available and distributed in a reasonable amount of time with a clear usage path.

Release notes are also a great opportunity to [praise participants](praise-participants.md)! As we know, [documentation is extremely important](project-setup/base-documentation.md) for new folks looking to get involved with your project. Praising outside teammates for contributions, including documentation and release notes, is a great way to foster community and grow your user base.
