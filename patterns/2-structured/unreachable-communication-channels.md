## Title

Unreachable Communication Channels

## Patlet

Communications channels require explicit access requests that leave the organization silo-ed. A public portal was created to build transparency for InnerSource practice, process, and impact.

## Problem

Currently at the organization there is a silo-ed culture for communication channels. People that work in certain areas of the organization need explicit communication access to others, even when they are using a similar toolchain (e.g. Microsoft Teams). This can be extended to geographical locations.

## Context

Highly regulated industries experience high scrutiny for information publicly shared. Internally companies experience similar limitations between departments and teams.

## Forces

Against:
Existing regulation that forces the organization to use local pieces of infrastructure unreachable by others within the corporation.
Sense of ownership and control of the communication channels or pieces of infrastructure to be used by the project.
In favor:
Willingness to use a shared and common repository
Need of the technical teams to use a shared repository for code management, tickets, etc.

## Solutions

The solution was to provide a central point where participants can find and teams/SIGs can ask for InnerSource-friendly (public, open, and indexed) communication channels.

## Resulting Context

Anyone in the InnerSource region (country, Europe, world level) has full transparency on the existing projects and they have read access by default. This process has to be transparent and as easy as possible to lower the barriers to contribution. The desired situation is that once you are within the firewall of the organization, you have full access to any project.
