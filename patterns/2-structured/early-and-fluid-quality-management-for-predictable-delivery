## Title

Early and fluid quality management for predictable delivery

## Patlet

Testing practices are often short-cutted to meet deadlines leading to stability questions regarding the code. Frequent code review and testing is embedded in a smaller pull-request culture. 

## Problem

Code stability depends on how confident we are on our tests. In some cases, proper testing is not taking place until later stages (even pre-production deployment), generating delays in the delivery of the releases. Part of the problem is the size of changes. Bigger changes are more difficult to review and test. In other words, our development code is sent to pre-production without passing the tests, creating blocks and loops against pre-production environments while fixing the issues.

## Forces

Against:
Time pressures by the business team.
Perfectionism on the technical teams.
Lack of confidence in the master branch of development, lack of stability.
Needs investments to reap benefit cycle after cycle.

In favor:
Agility is a trend in both software development and project management (lean)

## Solutions

Automated testing, routine code review, and frequent pull request processes are put in place to ensure quality. 

Planning: Break the delivery in smaller chunks (minimum viable changes). This goes also for processes and tooling.
Coordination: Agree on outcome validation criteria upfront.
Culture: Define needs and outcome, not the solution
Culture: Approve as soon as situation improves (don’t wait for perfection) and iterate to improve
Culture: Stakeholders watch and participate in development according to their capabilities (pull request culture).
Automate testing to reduce cycle times and repetitive effort

## Resulting Context

Since changes are small and review is very automated, reviews are swift and problems are detected early, so they are fixed quickly.
Early and flawless delivery of key functionality provides and hardens confidence in the development.
Common pull request culture enables other stakeholders to provide and validate solution proposals. Development accelerates with InnerSource contributions.
