## Title

Feature Owners

## Patlet

This pattern is for scaling inner source project contributions aligned with business initiatives and for aspirant associates who are looking for stretch assignments, more accountability, develop their soft skills and be successful at work.

## Problem

Contributions in innersource projects mostly are all volunteer based. Below are the challenges we see in day-to-day life:
- How to increase more contributions in the project.
- How to create opportunities for associates who want to play more than an individual contributor role and are looking for:
    - Elevating leadership skills.
    - More visibility at work.
    - More accountability.
    - Developing their soft skills. 
    - Motivations and inspiring others. 

## Story

A single project which is on high demand and consumption is increasing every month. We need to expand the contributions and add new functionalities. But associates have a concern on how they can play more than an individual contributor role and which will motivate them to contribute more.

## Context

Business & [Community leader](patterns/2-structured/core-team.md) looking for scaling inner source contributions and to drive engaging associate experiences by maximizing their development and growth. 



## Forces

- [Community core team](patterns/2-structured/dedicated-community-leader.md) is composed of small number of people. They have core responsibilities and are not always available for guidance.
- As project grows, we need more subject matter experts in the space to scale the development and maintain the project.


## Solution

Define all the features needed in the project. Per definition, <em>"A feature is the product's service/function that provides business value, meets customer needs and must be able to be done in 2-3 months".</em> 

Invite all contributors for open participation. Empower associates to pick the features which they would be interested in and become feature owners. There can be more than one owner for any given feature.

Feature owners responsibilities:
- Analyze the work. 
- Complete the end to end development.
- Document & provide guidelines.
- Educate community core team & community members.
- Demo the feature work at the appropriate venues.
- Support feature critical issues. Refer [30-day-warranty Pattern]((patterns/2-structured/30-day-warranty.md)).
- Maintain feature work based on bandwidth OR find additional feature owners.
- Review contributions to the feature.
- Become SMEs on that feature.
