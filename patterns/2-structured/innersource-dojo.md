## Title

InnerSource Dojo

## Patlet

An InnerSource Dojo is a structured environment where participants collaboratively create, share and refine content, tools and practices using InnerSource methodologies.  This fosters a culture of continuous learning, innovation and collective improvement.  It can be applied to various domains such as Agile / DevOps / DevSecOps practices, InnerSource methodologies, Systems Thinking exploration and or Mindset transformation.

## Problem

Establishing a sustainable, collaborative environment that ensures consistent and up-to-date content while engaging a diverse group of participants is challenging.  Variations in contributions, unclear objectives and maintaining momentum can hinder progress.

## Context

The InnerSource Dojo is designed for organizations aiming to harness the power of InnerSource to streamline content creation and maintenance.  This setting brings together individuals from various backgrounds, expertise and roles to collaboratively work on shared goals, ensuring the content remains relevant and beneficial.

## Forces

1. **Diversity of Participants**: The Dojo involves individuals with different backgrounds, expertise and expectations.
1. **Need for Safe Spaces**: Participants must feel safe to share their insights and challenges.
1. **Continuous Engagement**: Ongoing participation is crucial for maintaining the Dojo's momentum and impact.
1. **Knowledge Sharing**: Effective methods for sharing knowledge and best practices are essential.

## Solutions

Adopt a structured approach to create and sustain an InnerSource Dojo, focusing on clear objectives, inclusive participation and continuous improvement.  Implement the following steps:

1. **Define the Purpose**: Clearly articulate the Dojo's purpose and goals, ensuring alignment with broader organizational objectives.
1. **Establish Social Conventions**: Develop and communicate social conventions that promote respect, inclusivity and open dialogue.  Encourage members to adhere to these guidelines to create a safe and supportive environment.
1. **Facilitate Regular Meetings**: Schedule regular meetings to maintain engagement and momentum.  Use these sessions for open discussions, sharing insights and addressing challenges.  Meetings are open for unpacking issues, with goals set by attendees.
1. **Rotate Leadership**: Promote shared leadership by rotating the facilitation role among members, fostering ownership and responsibility.
1. **Use Collaborative Tools**: Utilize tools like Jitsi Meet, Slack and GitHub for communication and documentation.  Insights can be optionally shared on social channels, ensuring privacy.
1. **Encourage Voluntary Code Contribution**: Foster an environment where contributions are voluntary, allowing individuals to work on what interests them and aligning with their strengths.
1. **Prioritized Mentorship**: Implement a mentorship structure with Sensei (teachers) providing guidance and Senpai (senior students) supporting newer members. This dual-layer mentorship enhances skill development and community cohesion.
1. **Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement**: Regularly seek feedback to identify improvement areas, refining the Dojo's structure and activities accordingly.

## Resulting Context
