## Title

Misusing Metrics

## Patlet

Metrics can be misused causing friction across teams. In these situations, create a sense of ownership within teams on how to use the data, avoiding comparisons, and begin measuring progress with deltas.

## Problem

The existence of metrics may lead to undesired situations and frictions across teams. Gamifications, list of rock stars or any other way of having people or teams “better” than others usually brings into the discussion defensive behaviors where the metric needs to be deprecated.

## Context

There is often a competitive spirit within development teams. In these situations, metrics tend to be used as evidence that supports a “better than” culture. This culture is a barrier to the healthy use of metrics to inform the successful progress in development velocity.

## Forces

* Individuals or teams may not understand the purpose of the metrics being used
* Individuals or teams may feel threatened by how the metrics are being used
* Leadership doesn’t understand how to utilize the metrics in a healthy way

## Solutions

Get a team internal agreement about the metrics that make sense in that specific team. Build a sense of ownership so everyone has contributed to the definition of the metric. Educate people about the right use of metrics and avoid comparisons. Measure deltas instead of net numbers, and look for outliers and how far projects are from the average instead of stating some behavior is “good” or “bad”.

## Resulting Context

Everyone being tracked and ongoing tracking are aligned into the existing and needed metrics. These metrics are publicly documented and anyone can learn from them. An existing set of metrics are part of the usual work of the teams with the goal of improving efficiency.
