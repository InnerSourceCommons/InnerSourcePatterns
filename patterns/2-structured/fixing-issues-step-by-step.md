## Title

Fixing Issues Step by Step

## Patlet

Solving an issue by deadline without consideration of the current scope of change to process causes developer frustration and decreased efficiencies. Utilize a continuous improvement approach which right-sizes the work and provides realistic expectations.

## Problem

Results are expected to take place within a few days/weeks after a process has started. Adding a process or a toolchain by itself will not provide any result by itself beyond developer frustration. Stating that something has to work by a certain deadline will not make it possible, this will just force the situation and workarounds will be done by developers.

## Forces

Understanding step changes in a process requires adequate time and clarity of impact
Clarity of impact to the process and delivery pressure are deterrents to change

## Solutions

When planning new steps, set the way that step is successful if compared to others. Follow a continuous improvement approach and measure the delta between steps.

## Resulting Context

Expectations are aligned and realistic in terms of the improvement path of the organization. A continuous improvement is required and understood.
