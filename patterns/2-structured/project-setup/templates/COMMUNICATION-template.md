# COMMUNICATION.md

***
Put an individual COMMUNICATION.md file tailored to the project in each repo. If project repo ownership is transferred to a different team in the future, they need to be able to access and edit documentation related to the project. This includes documentation that outlines the communication processes that users should use to contact the team.

**Delete top paragraph when this section is filled out.**

## Documentation Contacts

Tell how to find the owner, responsible party, or group people should contact if they have questions about documentation in the repo.

Describe this communication process.

For example:

* If you have questions on a specific piece of documentation, you can find the team member responsible for the information by looking here:
* You can contact the responsible party by sending a message in the xyz channel, send them a direct message in chat, email, etc. The individual who last certified the documentation is the responsible party.
