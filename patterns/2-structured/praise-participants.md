## Title

Praise Participants

## Patlet

When you receive an InnerSource contribution, it's important to thank the contributor for their time and effort.
Extending your gratiutude not only effectively acknowledges the contribution but also engenders further engagement from the contributor and others.
Praising contributors' positive contributions to your InnerSource project motivates those contributors (and their managers) to continue investing in the effort. 

## Problem

How can we properly express our gratitude to a contributor for their InnerSource contribution to a project?
We may not know precisely which words or communication channels we should use to express ourselves sincerely.
Effective praise for participants follows a pattern, and following this pattern helps ensure that our messages of thanks come across clearly and graciously.
It also makes us less likely to forget to praise our contributors, which is unfortunately too easy to do.

## Context

* You are the [Trusted Committer](./trusted-committer.md) or maintainer on an InnerSource project.
* You value the community of contributors and want to maintain and grow it.

## Forces

* You are busy, forgetting some soft touches (like praise and thanks) easier.
* You may not be someone that is comfortable in social situations or good with words.
* Peer recognition is very important to job satisfaction and career development.

## Solutions

Being recognized by others feels good.
And in a professional setting, recognition from peers can also increase your organizational influence and career growth.
Any time someone contributes to your InnerSource project, recognize them with an authentic sincere "thank you."

For non-trivial contributions (all code contributions and significant time contributions), say "thank you" via the following mechanisms:

(1) Call out the person by name in any chat location (e.g. _Slack_) where you organize your project activity.
Let everyone know what they did and thank them publicly.
For example:

> Everyone @here give a high-five to @andrew.clegg for updating the _rcs-viewer_ to the latest version of the _hebo-client_ (https://github.com/rcs/rcs-viewer/pull/81).
> Thanks for helping keep this library up-to-date, Andy!

(2) Email them and their manager (cc'd) privately, thanking them for the contribution.
For code contributions, consider forwarding the merge notification mail.

Example:

> Hi, Andy, I want to thank you again for making this update.
> It may have been a small amount of time, but it's attention like this from each person that make the RCS project work for all of us.
> Thanks for solving your own problem in a way that also makes the _rcs-viewer_ better for everyone.

## Resulting Context

Feedback like this leaves the contributor with a fantastic feeling and ready to re-engage in the project.
Combining **both** forms of thanks gives them recognition in front of their peers (breadth) and in front of their direct manager (depth).
There's a subtle encouragement for those peers in chat to consider contributing themselves and for that manager to look for appropriate circumstances to encourage their other direct reports to do the same.
Additionally, awareness of the InnerSource project spreads to the manager, who may have previously not known of the team's use and involvement with it.

One caveat: keep it real.
Make sure that your words stem from the sincere thanks that you feel inside for what they've done.
Keep the level and verbosity of praise appropriate to their level of involvement.
Overdoing it may feel insincere and mechanical and defeat your purpose in reaching out.
